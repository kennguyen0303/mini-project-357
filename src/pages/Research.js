                  <h2>1. Survey</h2>
                  <h4>A. Method</h4>
                  <p>
                  In order to collect the information regarding the usersâ€™ 
                  screen habit, we have run a survey on Google Form and shared 
                  it on our social network (Facebook) and the class 
                  communicating protocols including Slack and Discord. 
                  After two days running the form, we received 38 answers. 
                  Based on these answers, our hypothesis was confirmed and 
                  the needs of the users were established. 
                  </p>
                  <h4>B. Our analysis</h4>
                  <p>
                  1. Most of the participants were students and workers who must 
                  switch to study and work remotely. Thus, they found Covid-19 
                  has an impact on their screen habit. (Graphs: age, employment 
                  status and covid impact)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  2. The majority spend from 6 to 10 hours working on their smartphones or laptops for 
                  their school / work per day. An increase by 30-50 hours on screen per week. 
                  (Apps and hours used often)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  3. Most people regret spending too much time than wanted on social 
                  networks or streaming Apps (such as Youtube). (Apps used too often)
