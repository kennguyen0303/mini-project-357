           <h3>What we learned</h3>
           <p>This project was such a rewarding challenge for us. We think that the hardest part is to understand the current situation and analyze the user's need.
               Afer the research, we were able to know how COVID 19 has affected to people's daily lifestyle and offer a solution that can help people cope with it.

           </p>
           <h3>Next Steps</h3>
           <p>- Develop a business model so that we can extend the application for more audience</p>
           <br/>
           <p>- Research on how to reward user more accurately</p>
           <br/>
           <p>- Review our prototype with real user so we can enhance our user expererience</p>
