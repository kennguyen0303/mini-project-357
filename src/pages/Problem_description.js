                  <p>Covid-19 has brought the sedentary lifestyle to another level. 
                    The workplace is remote. Restaurants and gyms are closed. 
                    The quarantine is taking a toll on our mental health as it
                     affects our daily healthy routines which involve outdoor 
                     activities. Now, most of the time people spend on seeing each
                      other is via their devices’ screens.
                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    To advocate a healthy screen habit, many applications and 
                    devices use screen time as an indicator to analyze the users’
                     usage. Once these products detect a prolonged session, their 
                     users often receive a reminder to take a break. The problem with 
                     this approach is its impact on the users’ habit. A reminder does 
                     not reward the users, it asks them to stop voluntarily. Hence, 
                     many users find it hard to stop themselves in the middle of
                      attractive activities like games and movies. Some other users 
                      struggle not to touch the phone to check for updates on their 
                      Newsfeed or inbox. Thus, rewarding users for their good acts is 
                      the key component our product wants to target.
